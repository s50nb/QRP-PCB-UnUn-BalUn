# QRP PCB UnUn/BalUn

*Simple, small, light and portable.*

The main point of portable QRP operation is to be as light as possible, Specially for those of us who enjoy SOTA and POTA activations. Its based off a well known design (If I knew who the original designer was I would credit him personally here).Modified to work both as a UnUn for EFHW and random wire antennas, as well as a 1:1 or 4:1 BalUn for regular or OCF dipoles or even loops of desired. 

I have also added STEP files for those of you who would like to 3d print different encloasures and integrate it into wire spoles. 

BOM:

- 1x FT50-43 toroid
- 1x 100nf 3kV ceramic THT capacitor 
- 1x BNC Right Angle PCB Jack Through Hole Bulkhead Rear Mount 50 Ohm Isolated (Amphenol 031-5486 for instance)
- 0.3mm(28AWG) or 0.5mm(24AWG) enameled copper wire (As long as you can wind 14 turns around the toroid, any size you have will do actually)
